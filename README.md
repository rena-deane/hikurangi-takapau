Learn about Te Takapau a Maui

## Learnings
- React
- React-router
- React-DOM
- Web APIs
- SQL
- Using redux will be more efficient than `ComponentWillMount()`.  It felt like I was using a large amount of unnecessary code.

## Favourite Moment
- I used a function within react called `ComponentWillMount()`to fetch weather from Yahoo Weather.
- I used a ternary statement to render a loading gif which introduced me to the changes in state.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Three.js or any technology that allows me to create a walkthrough the carvings
- [ ] Reference Yahoo Weather to the Weather component
- [ ] Use Firebase or Postgres as database
- [ ] Render information from the database
