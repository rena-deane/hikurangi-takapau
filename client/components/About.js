                        To celebrate the dawning of the new millennium “Te Takapau a Maui”, a series of nine whakairo (carved art works), were commissioned for the maunga. Maui, a legendary Ngati Porou ancestor, accomplished many heroic deeds - including fishing up Te Ika a Maui ( the North Island). The people of Ngati Porou believe Hikurangi provides the final resting place of Maui’s waka (canoe) Nukutaimemeha. The whakairo stand as a tribute to the cultural heritage of Ngati Porou, and a legacy for future generations.

                        Hikurangi is an experience the Iwi (tribe) would like to share with manuhiri (visitors) from around New Zealand and more distant places around the globe. For Guided Te Ara ki Hikurangi four-wheel-drive tours and tramping information our Tourism Ngati Porou office can help.
